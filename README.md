+ Project summary: In this project, we created two models to identify graphs into night categories. For model 1, we created a basic CNN model and worked on the noisy labels. For model 2, we used a Multi-Task Label Cleaning Architecture. We first input the images and all the labels to find the pattern behind the noisy labels and correct all the noise. Then, rerun model 1 on the cleaned labels.
